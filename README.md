>Bitcoin is often referred to as the "global ledger," even though this ledger is the entire bill for just one currency, BTC. Accordingly, Ethereum can be thought of as a "global computer": a place where anyone can upload and execute an application, and where the effective execution of the program is guaranteed, relying on the highly robust, decentralized, consensus network of thousands of computers around the world in the Ethereum system.
